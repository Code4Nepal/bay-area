- More languages & crowdsourcing (details TBD, we might have to prioritize and leave on of the tasks for later)
- Swap development roles. We can chose to swap our roles in what we have been doing. This will have these benefits: 
  - Will give opportunity for folks to learn new things that they may not yet know
  - Will improve documentation, as different sets of developers will learn about problems
