## Meeting Minutes

* The event was scheduled at a very last moment but everyone made it (yay!).
* **Prashish** kicked off the meeting with an introduction session & a recap from the [previous meetup](/meetup05.md).
* **Prasanna** took the stage to give the group an update on लेखनी कि-बोर्ड. He successfully added dictionary to the new release and it is working as expected.
* After a brief discussion on *Golden Circle*, the *WHY?s* for the idea were: nepali language was linguistically better, current tools are not user friendly & are closed source, need to write/express in Nepali across all products.
* The next steps for लेखनी कि-बोर्ड is to organize a hackathon or focused work session & come up with release candidate.
* The long term plan is to add newari language support.
* Prasanna will come up with a technical roadmap with a set agenda in the next meetup.
* **Aishraj** then took the stage to speak about GSoC application.
* He talked about all the possible projects that Code for Nepal can list. The complete and rough list can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10CmHBOEVfnZDL1h7ptcJpa1sfeEh1bsNlcW7t0qr0jM/edit)
* The next step is to organize a Docathon to finalize wiki, ideas, project contact & resources for the project.
* The date is set on 16th Dec, 2017. This will be a focused session and won't be published in the group. 
* Once we have all the resources finalized for GSoC application, we will open it up to the public for a broader discussion.

**Next meetup date:**  Not finalized
