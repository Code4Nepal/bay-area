Prasanna 
 - Traveled a lot.
 -  Tried to build auto complete. 
 -  Does not come out of the box. Will need Anup's help. 
 - TODO: talk about auto-complete once the MVP is done

Ijesh
- Seems pustakalaya.org was down and later the latency was high.
- Kritish found Sahitya sanghraha, which had a lot of content.
- Suggestion: Keep OCR in the background and use content from there.

Anup
- Setup the ElasticSearch version, upgraded the Docker image
- Added the stop word lists
- Documented the ElasticSearch operations
- Planning to run on an existing DigitalOcean instance.

Nripesh
- No major updates. Created Docker image etc.
- Added my code to a branch.
- People who want to use OCR an pull the Docker image and use it.
- Have added the essential instructions and published to Docker Hub

Pragya:
- Found the Tesseract python package and may need to change the Docker package that Nripesh created.
- Tried figuring out how to use Elasticsearch confidence scores etc. Will need Ijesh/Prasanna's help.
