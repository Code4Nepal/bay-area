# Retrospective (Lessons learnt):

- Better Documentation
- New people should be writing documentation
- Communication - repeating work, not knowing what needs to be done (Github issues and tracking rigorously)
- Easily adaptable roadmap / Roadmap broken down into small measurable goals
- Alignment across what next
- Onboarding
- Packaging tickets
- Start meeting with updates and status
- Demos when new feature implemented (if possible)
- Retroaction: change meetings to biweekly(every other week), make it more of a brainstorming/big picture meeting rather than a standup
