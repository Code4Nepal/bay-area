# Meeting Notes

## Updates

### Prasanna 

- Basic landing page
- Fix the URL mapping, site is now operable

### Aish

- Code4Nepal now owns sangraha.org (!!!!)
- We have trial AWS account from Ravi
- TechSoup provides a 3k (?) AWS account for non-profits but it costs some money. That is something that Aish and Ravi are exploring.
- We have a connection with nep-ocr's author. Aish connected Nripesh with him. We will invite him to one of the meetings when the MVP is more demonstrable.
